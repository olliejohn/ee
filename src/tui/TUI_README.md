#TUI

TUI (or Text User Interface) is the wrapper for ncurses used by Yaw. It's main
purpose is simplifying the use of Unicode, but it also provides, to a lesser
degree, simpler window and color management as well as a more concise and
user-friendly API.

The demo file is not part of Yaw but it simply used for testing features of TUI.
