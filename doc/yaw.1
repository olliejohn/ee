.SH NAME
yaw \- Yet Another Writer, extensible text editor with built-in terminal
emulator

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B yaw
.I [OPTIONS]\ [\+LINE,COLUMN]\ [FILES]
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page briefly describes the Yaw text editor.

Yaw is a command line text-editor designed to be as simple to use as possible
whilst still being powerful and extensible.

Yaw is still in the early stages of development and so it NOT recomended for
ACTUAL work (see the \fINOTES\fP section for more information).

Yaw currently features:
.IP \[bu] 2
Opening multiple buffers at once in tabs
.IP \[bu]
A built in terminal emulator
.IP \[bu]
Extensibility and configuation with the built in Lisp interpretter

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \+\fILINE\fP,\fICOLUMN\fP
Places cursor at line number \fILINE\fP and column number \fICOLUMN\fP (at least
one of which must be specified) on startup, instead of the default of line 1,
column 1.

.SH CONFIGURATION
The Yaw configuaration file is found at ~/.yaw

Any time that Yaw starts up and does not find this file, it will write the
default configuration to this location.

.SH NOTES
Yaw is still in the very early stages of development and so is still quite
buggy and is still lacking some important (and some not so important) features.
For this reason it is very much recommended that Yaw is NOT used for actual
work until the release of the first stable version. The usual disclaimers
asscociated with the GNU GPL also apply (see \fICOPYING\fP for more details).
