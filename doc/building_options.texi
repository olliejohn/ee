@chapter Building Options

Building @code{Yaw} from source is very straight forward if you are familiar
with the process. It simply requires moving into the 'yaw' directory then
performing @code{make && make install}

This process is dependant on the following packages:

@itemize @bullet
@item GCC (it may be possible to use some other C compiler but this is untested,
unsupported and the source may require some modifications)
@item ncursesw
@item make (or some compatable variant)
@end itemize

Building and installing the documentation will also require man, gzip, info and
makeinfo.

Updating the ChangeLog will also require Perl and Git (and, needless to say,
Yaw's Git commit history).
