Most of Yaw's functionality can be accessed from the following key commands. In
addition to this, any of these shortcuts (and many others) can be rebound in the
Lisp interpreter. See section 'X' for more information on how to do this.

The following is a list of all of Yaw's default key binds. 'C-S' should be read
as 'press s while holding down control'.

@table @code

@item C-Q
Quit Yaw

@item C-S
Save the current buffer. If the buffer has not yet been given a name, a prompt
will appear in the command line asking for one.

@item C-N
Create a new buffer in a new tab

@item C-O
Open a file in a new buffer

@item C-B
Move the focus to the buffer window

@item C-G
Move the focus to the command line

@item C-T
Move the focus to the terminal

@item C-X

@item C-C

@end table
