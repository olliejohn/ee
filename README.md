#Yaw

Yaw is a command line text editor with the goal of being as easy to jump into as
Nano and as configuarable as Vim.

NOTE: Yaw is still under heavy development - it is distributed in the hope that
it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty
of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General
Public License for more details. Do NOT use Yaw for editing documents that you
don't have copies of elsewhere - it is not yet stable.

Yaw currently features:
-Opening multiple buffers at once in tabs
-A built in terminal emulator
-Extensibility and configuation with the built in Lisp interpretter

My main focus for the moment is taking what we have so far (about 5500 lines of
C as of 29th April 2014) and making it as stable and, ultimately, useable as
possible. I will, however, continue to add features along the way.
